Exersise for the LPC935 microprocessor

Ex 1:
Explain the difference between the four modes of power management. Make one
program to activate each one.

Ex 2:
Present the LST program of the following exercise:
Considering a key connected in IE0 and a sensor connected in IE1, activating a horn
(P2.7) for 1 second if the sensor interrupts the LPC935 and blinks a led 5 times if the
is enabled. On the LCD display the messages LED ON or BUZZER
ON for 1 second or when LED is blinking. Stay in Power Down Total while holding.

Ex 3:
Activate external interrupts 0 (presence sensor) and 1 (on / off switch). Stay in
Idle mode. If presence detected BEEP (P2.0) is triggered for 10 seconds. If
key is added enter Power Down Total mode.
